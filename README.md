Introduction
This project is one of the required projects in the Udacity Data Analyst Degree. The goal of this project was to analyze local and global temperature data and compare the local temperature with global temperature.

First of all, local temperature and global temperatuers were extracted using SQL from a database provided by Udacity, and then a 7 - year Moving Average was calculated from both the global and local temperature to smooth out the lines in the excel graph.

At the end a Line Chart was made using Excel and couple of observation made based on the Line Chart.

My take on the project

It was a good Introduction to data analyzing as it made us experince the data analyst cycle, like defining the problem and then gathering data for it, and visualizing it and then stating our observations.

Project 1 - Explore Weather Trends.pdf  holds all the project steps and how they were implemented.

Gloabal V.S. Riyadh.xlsx, holds the data of the 7 - year moving average of both local and global temperatures, and the Line Chart.
